# ReactChamps

## Goal
This project is a way for me to practice and perfect my React programming skills. It is a learning tool that allows me to experiment and try various things out when it comes to front-end development. It also allows me to discover new technologies and learn to master them, all based around a theme that personnaly interests me : video games, and particularly League of Legends.

## Tools used

|  Software |  Version |  Link |
|---|---|---|
| React |17.0.1|https://fr.reactjs.org/|
| React Router |5.2.0|https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start|
| Material-UI | 4.11.2  |  https://material-ui.com/ |
| MDI (Material Design Icons |5.9.55|https://materialdesignicons.com/|
| Typescript |4.1.5|https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/|
| Webpack |5.21.2| https://webpack.js.org/concepts/ |
| Webpack Dev Server|3.11.2|https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/|

## Choices

I use React Hooks in my project over React class components, as it allows

I choose to use Material-UI for its ease of setup and utilisation, which allows me to focus more on learning React and other techs rather than spend too much time on style etc...

I also decided to go for Typescript over native Javascript, as I have the background of a OOP developer (I mostly studied programming through Java) and thus feel more familiar and performant with TypeScript.

I decided to use Webpack for an easier loading of my assets (such as CSS and TS), as well as a clearer config method (through the webpack.config.js file).

I also decided solely use external APIs (Riot Games DataDragon for example) as my goal for this project is not to set up my own backend (which I could), but rather to focus on learning front-end development.
